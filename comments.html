<h2>A Short, Personal Reflection</h2>
    <p>I am brand new to HTML and this was a brilliant introduction to the fundamentals of the Internet. I discovered many exciting features while working on this project. I'm particuraly fond of <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">gradients.</span></p>
<h2>Technical Aspects</h2>

<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
<p>There are two perspectives a web designer must keep in mind while they design their website; the computer's perspective and the user's. Firstly, your webpage must be adaptable so all devices can display a version of your page, whether the user's device be a Power Mac from the 90s or a mobile device that is yet to be invented. Secondly, it is important to incorporate a user-centric design - if a user cannot use a feature, it may as well not exist.</p>
<p>When the Internet's aesthetic was being developed in the 90s, it was designed around the constraints of 8-bit colour and 56k dial-up. This defined the now universally accepted standards of media compression and hyperlinking. Any user should be able to theoretically visit your website so long as you adhere to the design-principals of the Internet. A well designed webpage will be compatabile with web browsers for the entire conceivable future. https://alistapart.com/article/the-web-aesthetic/</p>
<p>Secondly, it is vital for your website to have a user-friendly experience. Very few users will tolerate with a clunky website as they expect instant gratification. A clear, concise index is necessary so the user can efficiently reach the page they desire. Users do not read webpages, they scan, hence why the desired information must be readily available for the user. https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/10-principles-of-effective-web-design/</p>
<p>I have encorporated these two fundamental design principals into my website. The site is built from pure self-contained HTML and CSS which have been accepted standards of the Internet for over 20 years. This means that my website is compatabile with any up-to-date web browser and will likely be supported for years to come with little maintanance required.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the website is designed primarily with the user in mind. The navigation bar at the top indicates the pages available as well as what page the user is currently on. The layout of  individual web pages has been purposely refined to be glancible, highlighted text supported by visuals, as a user is unlikely to read entire paragraphs.</P>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>The webpage includes two key accessability features:</p>
<ol><li>Each image is tagged with alt which would describe the picture should it not be able to be displayed.</li>
<li>The website is easy to navigate as the navigation panel clearly highlights what page the user is on. Furthermore, the navigation panel is made from contrasting colours incase the user is unable to read the white title against the pale-blue background.</li></ol>
